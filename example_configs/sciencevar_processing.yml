oxygen_concentration_shifted:
  calculation: convert_do_mgL
  nc_var_name: oxygen_concentration_shifted_mgL
  attrs:
    long_name: Time-lag Adjusted Dissolved Oxygen
    units: mg L-1
    observation_type: calculated
    ancillary_variables: oxygen_concentration_shifted
    comment: Applied QC (if applicable) and transformed oxygen_concentration_shifted from umol/L to mg/L
sbe41n_ph_ref_voltage_shifted:
  calculation: calculate_ph
  nc_var_name: pH
  attrs:
    long_name: Time-lag Adjusted pH
    standard_name: sea_water_ph_reported_on_total_scale
    units: "1"
    observation_type: calculated
    ancillary_variables: sbe41n_ph_ref_voltage_shifted pressure temperature salinity
    valid_min: 0.0
    valid_max: 14.0
    comment: pH total calculated from sensor calibration coefficents, QCd and interpolated pressure, QCd and interpolated salinity, QCd and interpolated temperature and measured reference voltage shifted by an optimal time shift calculated by glider segment in order to minimize separation between glider down and upcasts.
